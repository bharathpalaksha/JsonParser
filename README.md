JsonParser
==========

Java library to parse JSON

JSON - JavaScript Objet Notation
JSON is a very convenient form of transfering data over the web between client and server, so there is a need to parse the incoming JSON data from client at the server-side and also covert data into JSON before sending a response to the client from server.

There are already many JSON parsers like Jackson, GSON (from google). But, it can be made better.
